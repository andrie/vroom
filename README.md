The fastest delimited reader for R, **1.04 GB/sec**.

But that‚Äôs impossible\! How can it be [so
fast](https://jimhester.github.io/vroom/articles/benchmarks/benchmarks.html)?

vroom doesn‚Äôt stop to actually *read* all of your data, it simply
indexes where each record is located so it can be read later. The
vectors returned use the [Altrep
framework](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html) to
lazily load the data on-demand when it is accessed, so you only pay for
what you use.

vroom also uses multiple threads for indexing and materializing
non-character columns, to further improve performance.

| package    |    version | time (sec) | speedup | throughput |
| :--------- | ---------: | ---------: | ------: | ---------: |
| vroom      | 0.0.0.9000 |       1.60 |   67.42 |    1.04 GB |
| data.table |     1.12.0 |      19.75 |    5.47 |   84.38 MB |
| readr      |      1.3.1 |      26.61 |    4.06 |   62.64 MB |
| read.delim |      3.5.1 |     108.13 |    1.00 |   15.42 MB |

## Features

vroom has nearly all of the parsing features of
[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org) for delimited files, including

  - delimiter guessing\*
  - custom delimiters (including multi-byte\* and unicode\* delimiters)
  - specification of column types (including type guessing)
      - numeric types (double, integer, number)
      - logical types
      - datetime types (datetime, date, time)
      - categorical types (characters, factors)
  - skipping headers, comments and blank lines
  - quoted fields
  - double and backslashed escapes
  - whitespace trimming
  - windows newlines
  - [reading from multiple files or
    connections\*](#reading-multiple-files)

\* *these are additional features only in vroom.*

However vroom does not currently support embedded newlines in headers or
fields.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jimhester/vroom")
```

## Usage

vroom uses the same interface as readr to specify column types.

``` r
vroom::vroom("mtcars.tsv",
  col_types = list(cyl = "i", gear = "f",hp = "i", disp = "_",
                   drat = "_", vs = "l", am = "l", carb = "i")
)
#> # A tibble: 32 x 10
#>   model           mpg   cyl    hp    wt  qsec vs    am    gear   carb
#>   <chr>         <dbl> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <lgl> <lgl> <fct> <int>
#> 1 Mazda RX4      21       6   110  2.62  16.5 FALSE TRUE  4         4
#> 2 Mazda RX4 Wag  21       6   110  2.88  17.0 FALSE TRUE  4         4
#> 3 Datsun 710     22.8     4    93  2.32  18.6 TRUE  TRUE  4         1
#> # ‚Ä¶ with 29 more rows
```

## Reading multiple files

vroom natively supports reading from multiple files (or even multiple
connections\!).

First we will create some files to read by splitting the nycflights
dataset by airline.

``` r
library(nycflights13)
purrr::iwalk(
  split(flights, flights$carrier),
  ~ readr::write_tsv(.x, glue::glue("flights_{.y}.tsv"))
)
```

Then we can efficiently read them into one tibble by passing the
filenames directly to vroom.

``` r
files <- fs::dir_ls(glob = "flights*tsv")
files
#> flights_9E.tsv flights_AA.tsv flights_AS.tsv flights_B6.tsv flights_DL.tsv 
#> flights_EV.tsv flights_F9.tsv flights_FL.tsv flights_HA.tsv flights_MQ.tsv 
#> flights_OO.tsv flights_UA.tsv flights_US.tsv flights_VX.tsv flights_WN.tsv 
#> flights_YV.tsv
vroom::vroom(files)
#> # A tibble: 336,776 x 19
#>    year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>          <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
#> 1  2013     1     1      810            810         0     1048
#> 2  2013     1     1     1451           1500        -9     1634
#> 3  2013     1     1     1452           1455        -3     1637
#> # ‚Ä¶ with 3.368e+05 more rows, and 12 more variables: sched_arr_time <dbl>,
#> #   arr_delay <dbl>, carrier <chr>, flight <dbl>, tailnum <chr>,
#> #   origin <chr>, dest <chr>, air_time <dbl>, distance <dbl>, hour <dbl>,
#> #   minute <dbl>, time_hour <dttm>
```

## Benchmarks

The speed quoted above is from a dataset with 14,776,615 rows and 11
columns, see the [benchmark
article](https://jimhester.github.io/vroom/articles/benchmarks/benchmarks.html)
for full details of the dataset and
[bench/](https://github.com/jimhester/vroom/tree/master/bench) for the
code used to retrieve the data and perform the benchmarks.

## RStudio caveats

RStudio‚Äôs environment pane auto-refresh behavior calls `object.size()`
which for Altrep objects can be extremely slow. This was fixed in
[rstudio\#4210](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/pull/4210) and
[rstudio\#4292](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/pull/4292), so it is
recommended you use a [daily version](https://dailies.rstudio.com/) if
you are trying to use vroom inside RStudio. For older versions a
workaround is to use the ‚ÄòManual Refresh Only‚Äô option in the environment
pane.
